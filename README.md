# OSTree-Images

This repository contains useful OCI container images suitable for booting on an ostree based system.
The main idea behind these repo is to provide different flavors of Fedora Silverblue/Kinoite.

## Flavors

1. fedora-nvsb - A stock Fedora SilverBlue image with added nvidia drivers. It allows a nvidia system to have atomic updates without dealing with failed driver compilations.
